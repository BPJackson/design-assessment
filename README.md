#Design Assessment

###Objectives:
1.   Your design has responsive components
	* Three break points
	* Desktop and two mobile views (mobile views are touch based)
	* Sensible feature parity in both desktop and mobile views
2.  Create a complete styleguide
3.  Design an application from content inventories using wireframes

##Instructions:

#####Create 3 wireframes for a website. 1 Desktop, 1 Tablet, and 1 Mobile
* They should look similar to the wireframes [here](http://www.thismanslife.co.uk/projects/lab/responsivewireframes/)
	* There isn't a tablet view given so get creative and decide how it would look!
* [Here](http://www.lifeishao.com/rwdwire/) is a great tool to help create your wireframes quickly!
* Use a system to differentiate the content sections(1,2,3 or A,B,C)
* At the minimum, you must include these content sections and place them in the appropiate place
	* Logo
	* 3 features
	* Link to this page
	* Title
	* Link to other page
	* Tag line
	* Nav bar
	* Site index/Copywright/Contact


#####Now create a styleguide for your app.
* You must use [Frontify](https://brand.frontify.com/d/qAiubNBytHKf/style-guide) to help organize it.
* It must include:
	* Typography
	* Audience
	* Proportions
	* Composition
	* Visual hierarchy
	* Color choices

#####Now that you have your wireframes and styleguide, build the app to spec.
* Keep in mind that it must be responsive @ 3 break points
* [This site](http://mattkersley.com/responsive/) is a pretty neat tool to check your work once it is deployed.

#####You should have four pieces by now:
* One set of Wireframes
* Styleguide with link
* Deployed App

#####Complete the exercise in user-testing
