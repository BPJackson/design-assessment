###Objectives:

	* Sensible feature parity in both desktop and mobile views

#####Now create a styleguide for your app.
	* Feel free to use [Frontify](https://brand.frontify.com/d/qAiubNBytHKf/style-guide) to help organize it.  
	*  It must include:
		* Typography
		* Audience
		* Proportions
		* Composition
		* Visual hierarchy
		* Color choices
#####Now that you have your wireframes and styleguide, build the app to spec. You don't need content in each section, but you must indentify what each section represents.
	* Keep in mind that it must be responsive @ 2 break points 
	* You can use [this site](http://mattkersley.com/responsive/) to check your work once it is deployed. 

#####You should have these pieces by now:
	* Wireframes
	* Styleguide with link
	* Deployed App
