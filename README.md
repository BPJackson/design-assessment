#Design Assessment

###Objectives:
1.   Your design has responsive components
	* Three break points
	* Desktop and two mobile views (mobile views are touch based)
	* Sensible feature parity in both desktop and mobile views
2.  Create a complete styleguide
3.  Design an application from content inventories using wireframes

##Instructions:


#####Create 5 wireframes for a desktop view that detail the different pages of a site.
* They should look similar to the images in the wireframes folder. 
* Use a system to differentiate the content sections(1,2,3 or A,B,C)
* At the minimum, you must include these content sections and place them in the appropiate place
	* Logo
	* 3 features
	* 3 benefits
	* Link to this page
	* Title
	* Link to other page
	* Copyright info
	* Tag line
	* Nav bar
	* Site index
* Replace the provided images with your wireframes.
	* Keep the naming convention that is provided ie. desktop1.jpg, tablet1.jpg, mobile1.jpg


#####Create wireframes for the tablet and mobile views for each of the pages. 


#####Now create a styleguide for your app.
* You must use [Frontify](https://brand.frontify.com/d/qAiubNBytHKf/style-guide) to help organize it. 
* It must include:
	* Typography
	* Audience
	* Proportions
	* Composition
	* Visual hierarchy
	* Color choices

#####Now that you have your wireframes and styleguide, build the app to spec.
* Keep in mind that it must be responsive @ 3 break points
* [This site](http://mattkersley.com/responsive/) is a pretty neat tool to check your work once it is deployed.
* Once your app is built and deployed, take screenshots of it at each break point for each page. Replace the provided screenshots with your own and keep the names the same. 

#####You should have four pieces by now:
* Three sets of Wireframes
* Styleguide with link
* Deployed App
* Screenshots of your app

#####Complete the exercise in user-testing	


#####Place links here:
* Deployed app:
* Styleguide:
