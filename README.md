#Design Assessment

###Content Delivery:
1. Two sets of wireframes
2. Styleguide
3. Responsive App

###Objectives:

1.  Design has responsive components
	* At least two break points
	* Desktop and mobile views (mobile views are touch based)
	* Sensible feature parity in both desktop and mobile views
2.  Create a styleguide
3.  Design an application from content inventories using wireframes

###Instructions:

#####Create 5 wireframes that detail the different pages of a site.
* They should look similar to the wireframes provided in the images folder. Use a system to differentiate the content sections(1,2,3 or A,B,C)

#####Create 5 more wireframes that show the mobile view for each of the pages described above. Again, they should look similar to the wireframes provided in the images folder.

#####Now create a styleguide for your app.
* Feel free to use [Frontify](https://brand.frontify.com/d/qAiubNBytHKf/style-guide) to help organize it. It must include:
* Typography
* Audience
* Proportions
* Composition
* Visual hierarchy
* Color choices

#####Now that you have your wireframes and styleguide, build the app to spec. You don't need content in each section, but you must indentify what each section represents.
* Keep in mind that it must be responsive @ 2 break points
* You can use [this site](http://mattkersley.com/responsive/) to check your work once it is deployed.

#####You should have these pieces by now:
* Wireframes
* Styleguide with link
* Deployed App
