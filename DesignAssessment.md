	*  ![image](Mobile3.png)
	*  ![image](Mobile4.png)
	*  ![image](Mobile5.png)
* #####Now create a styleguide for your app.
	* Feel free to use [Frontify](https://brand.frontify.com/d/qAiubNBytHKf/style-guide) to help organize it.  
	*  It must include:
		* Typography
		* Audience
		* Proportions
		* Composition
		* Visual hierarchy
		* Color choices
* #####Now that you have your wireframes and styleguide, build the app to spec. You don't need content in each section, but you must indentify what each section represents.
	* Keep in mind that it must be responsive @ 2 break points 
	* You can use [this site](http://mattkersley.com/responsive/) to check your work once it is deployed. 

Once your app is completed, we must test it!
